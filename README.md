# jays_plumbing
This is my first Project for Code Louisville and as a developer in general.

I'm very new to the front end development community and highly passionate about moving forward and learning more. I didn't know a single thing about coding when I started this project! But I wanted to test the skills I've learned and challenge myself by using Jay's Plumbing current site (http://jaysplumbingky.com/) and completely over-hauling it!

I designed this knowing that I might one day launch into a live enviroment. I personally know the owner and will be meeting with him soon in-order to help Jay's Plumbing create leads and grow their business. I hope to do this by reaching more people through the convince of browsing on mobile devices, making it more accessable on social media and easier to find in internet searches.

I have several ideas that I wanted to implement into this project. I wanted to link their social media influence and stream all of their current content into a central hub. I'm currently working on a Plumber Sighting tool. Which would track the gps locations on all of Jay's Plumbing technicians that are in the area and displaying a real time location on a map for customers and administrators to track and see. It would give a generalized location (like a region or zipcode for customers to see, and a centralized location for administrations to get a more accurate view.)

I have a ton of Ideas for this project and I know it will develop more and more as I grow in my developing knowledge and skill. Due to the time contraints on this project I backed off on impletementing the plumber sighting tool as it would require a running backend and access to the technicians gps systems or phones. But there is a few plugins I added to help with social media interaction and a generalized form for new customers to fill out.

Hope you've enjoyed my project!

Blessings,
JSS
